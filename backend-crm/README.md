# Overview
This project creates a Docker image from a packaged jar file from a Spring Boot backend and runs the containers in my local development environment. I have created a docker-compose file where both containers, one for the Spring Boot application and one for the PostgreSQL database, run together with one command. 

The purpose of creating this project is to familiarize with container technology by having first-hand experience on dockerizing a web application and run it from the container.
